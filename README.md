# Watch-It-Calculate-Minus
Open source code of the WatchFace 'Watch it Calculate Minus' for the pebble smartwatch. Check it out here or on the pebble appstore.

Very similar to 'Watch it Calculate', just without the gray background.

It's open source so don't worry about it.
There is documentation in the code itself.
The logic for the calculating feature maybe a bit hard to swallow.
As far as the rest of the code is concerned, a chunk of it is from the pebble watchface tutorial.
So if you have any trouble understanding the logic, check out the watchface tutorial.
